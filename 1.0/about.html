                    <li>May be addressed using any one of the following: Olivia, Olivia Chen, 陈欣玥, Olive, O, you.</li>
                    <li>Currently working as an Android developer at a startup in Oakland, CA.</li>
                    <li>Order of personal preference: Java ~ C# >= Python, Ruby, C. Order not determined by skill at language but rather, general, stylistic preferences. Order may change depending on (a) time given or required for task to be completed using such language, (b) size of said task, (c) relative skill level and comfort at time of use, (d) other/miscellaneous/whim. </li>
                    <li>Didn't begin programming until after my freshman year in college. Went from Intended Biochemistry --> Intende   d Chemical Engineering (/Material Science Engineering) --> Computer Science. I owe you one, MATLAB and E7.
                    <li>Enjoyed lab work a lot in chem classes through the years. I think I always wrote too much though. (<i>Oh handcramps...</i>)</li>
                    <li>Used to display a mascot on my front page in the first version of this site.</li>
                    <li>Really likes small, furry animals. No, tarantulas do not count. Think more... <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hh9lWK-iwc" target="_blank">baby bunnies in glass cups</a>.</li>

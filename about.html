        <!--ABOUT PAGE CONTENT-->
        <p> You have entered the homepage and portfolio of Olivia Chen (or occhen).</p>
        <br>
        <p>I am currently a 2nd-year Computer Science major at the University of California, Berkeley. I wish I could detail an extensive history of my programming experience and showcase project after beautiful project, but as of yet, I am still relatively new to the coding universe. I began programming, not at the age of five, but last summer when I took an engineering course using MATLAB. Since then, I've been honing my skills through various coursework as well as by delving into personal projects, such as this website. As of right now, I'm trying to pick up Javascript, Python, and C.</p>
        <br>
        <p>This all said, please feel free to browse at your convenience, peek at my <a href="projects.html">projects</a>, visit my <a href="https://github.com/occhen11">GitHub</a>, or even shoot me an <a href="mailto:olivia.chen94@berkeley.edu">email</a>!  (Un)fortunately, most of my current GitHub repositories are private because they are former class projects, but if you're <i>not</i> a Cal student, I wouldn't mind sending a code sample upon request. </p>
        <br>
        <p>Well, enjoy!</p>
        <br>

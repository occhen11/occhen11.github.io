        <p>I am currently a 2nd-year Computer Science major at the University of California, Berkeley. I am very much a programming noob. In terms of my programming history, I actually did not begin learning how to code until the summer after my freshman year at Cal. Since I was younger, I had dabbled a bit in HTML via blogging platforms but by no means did I sit down and code anything extensively. In fact, I actually started university as an intended BioChem (or ChemBio, for anyone who knows the difference) major because I came from a strong background in biology and chemistry in high school. (Labs were the best--hands down.) Not long after, though, I veered toward Chemical Engineering, then Materials Engineering, and became one of those hopelessly lost students who couldn't pick a STEM field to enter. However, when I took the required intro to programming course for Engineering majors, I was sucked into the world of Computer Science by none other than Matlab.  So here I am a few months later, catching myself up to speed.</p>
